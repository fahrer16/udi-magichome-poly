# MagicHome-polyglot
This is the MagicHome Node Server for the ISY Polyglot interface.  
(c) fahrer16 aka Brian Feeney.  
MIT license. 

This was built on Debian 9 running on ESXi for ISY version 5.0.10 and polyglot v2 (https://github.com/Einstein42/udi-poly-template-python)
The original version for polyglot v1 is here: https://github.com/fahrer16/magichome-nodeserver

There are quite a few very inexpensive LED controllers that share the very simple TCP protocol used in the "MagicHome" app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Zengge.LEDWifiMagicHome&hl=en).
This node server was rewritten from its original version to use the flux_led repository written by Daniel Hiversen (https://github.com/Danielhiversen/flux_led).


# Installation Instructions:
Same as most other ISY node servers:

1. Backup ISY (just in case)
2. Add Node Server into Polyglot v2 instance:
  * Follow instructions here: https://github.com/Einstein42/udi-polyglotv2/wiki/Creating-a-NodeServer
3. The nodeserver uses multicast discovery to discover compatible LED controllers on the local subnet.  The discovery process can sometimes miss bulbs, so the node server optionally allows adding static entries for LED's to be added despite discovery.  The format is as follows:
  * Optional: Key starting with "led".  Value: {"ip":"192.168.0.84", "mac":"F0FEAF241937"}  "mac" is MAC address without ":"
  * Optional: Key: "delay".  Value: float corresponding to desired delay, in seconds, between issuance of command to controller and querying controller status.  Defaults to 1.0 seconds.
  * Optional: Key: "query_before_cmd".  Value: True or False.  Defaults to False.  When True, queries device immediately prior to issuing each command.
   
The LED controllers should show the correct status now, hit "Query" if the status fields are empty.  The connection to the LED controllers drops out frequently for me (maybe my network or WiFi setup, maybe my code is flaky).  I've noticed using the MagicHome app while the node server is connected to the controllers causes the node server to lose connection.

Known Issues:
- Communication to the LED controllers seems flaky at times.  Preventing anything other than polyglot from communicating with the LED controllers seems to improve the issue.  I've done my testing with all LED controllers on an isolated VLAN without internet access.
- The availability of Warm White controls is based on whether the LED controller reports it has WW LED capability, which doesn't mean there's actually a Warm White LED actually connected to the controller.
 
Version History:
* 2.0.0: Rewritten for Polyglot v2.  Included support for Warm White LED's.  I need someone to test this since I don't have any Warm White LED's
* 2.0.1: Corrected "mhbool" definition in editor profile
* 2.0.3: Added delay before querying controller status following issuance of a command.  Added closure of server.json file after reading.
* 2.0.4: Modified behavior of "Change RGB" and "Change RGBW" commands to turn on controller.  Previously, command only changed color.  Change made to allow command to be used in scenes.  Also added "query_before_cmd" key; when set to True the status of the device will be queried immediately prior to issuing each command.  Feature introduced for user that indicated devices were not responding to commands reliably.
* 2.1.0: Combined RGB and RGBW nodes into a single node (both definitions were kept for backwards compatability).  Previously, the report from the underlying flux_led protocol was used to determine whether to add a bulb with white capability or not.  Apparently this does not actually mean the bulb has warm or cold white LED's but rather refers only to the protocol type used.  Because the protocol isn't specific about whether a bulb does or does not have white capability, this will be exposed for all bulbs but obviously if a bulb does not actually have white LED's then this capability will not actually do anything.  Also added capability for cold white control.
* 2.1.1: Removed use of white LED's when setting preset "Warm White" and "Cold White" colors.
* 2.1.2: Corrected error in setRgbw command.
* 2.1.3: Removed check of flux_led package version to avoid issues resulting from that package not being upgraded automatically.
* 2.1.4: Removed blank line at the end of editors.xml
